we can use git with two different types of interfaces

1. graphical interface
2. terminal interface

but terminal interface is more used because it provides more functions.
git is created for linux project so it is primarly a command-line tool. it is core of git and most popular.

github is also available with gui interface their are many different interfaces are available but github desktop is mostly used.
git gui is easy because it not include command-line interfaces but not give all functionality to user.
https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/ --> this are different options for git gui interface.

git gui is easy to use better visual interface. friendly to use.

but in command line interface more thing available advanced features are available.

first of all we have confog git. when we are making change then git diffentiate different users from each other.

in list we can see as AUTHOR who is making changes. nameand email is configered and also we can configure name and email again.

git config user.name 
git config user.email  to check is there already a username email is configed or not.

git config --global user.name "Harsh Gajera"
git config --global user.email "harsh.gajera17@gmail.com"

git basic commands
ls --> lists the contents of your current directory


if you give command --> start . then it will open GUI for that directory.

in same directory do ls and folder from current directory will open that folder
start folder name to start that folder
