most important part in git is branching.
branching in git is same as linked list.

in git every commit has one unique hash. and each commit reference one parent commit so it is like linked list. alll node refernce one parent node.
address of parent node is pointed by each commit. first commit has none parent.

it is like linear commit one point to next one commit. 
in real project many person working on same project so it is not possible to linear so we need braching .

many person working on different featu then we need branching.

we can not working on linear commit in same project so we need branching in project.

we can work differently with branching. and also we can merge branches also.

we always work on main or master branch.
