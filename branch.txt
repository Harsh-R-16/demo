most important part in git is branching.
branching in git is same as linked list.

in git every commit has one unique hash. and each commit reference one parent commit so it is like linked list. alll node refernce one parent node.
address of parent node is pointed by each commit. first commit has none parent.

it is like linear commit one point to next one commit. 
in real project many person working on same project so it is not possible to linear so we need braching .

many person working on different featu then we need branching.

we can not working on linear commit in same project so we need branching in project.

we can work differently with branching. and also we can merge branches also.

we always work on main or master branch.
master branch is default branch. it is not special branch. now default branch in GITHUB is not master but it is main branch. in git still master branch is default branch.

$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean


head is current location where we are working.
head is refered to last commit in master branch.
head is referd to last commit in current branch.
head is like pointer.

git branch command 

we can not delete currenr branch. first we have to switch to onother branch and then delete that branch.

git branch -d command for deleting branch. we can not delete current branch. but if we use git branch -D command then we can delete current branch also its force delete branch command.

git branch -m command for renaming branch. m stand for move.

we can only rename current branch.
