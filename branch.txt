--> first-branch

most important part in git is branching.
branching in git is same as linked list.

in git every commit has one unique hash. and each commit reference one parent commit so it is like linked list. alll node refernce one parent node.
address of parent node is pointed by each commit. first commit has none parent.

it is like linear commit one point to next one commit. 
in real project many person working on same project so it is not possible to linear so we need braching .

many person working on different featu then we need branching.

we can not working on linear commit in same project so we need branching in project.

we can work differently with branching. and also we can merge branches also.

we always work on main or master branch.
master branch is default branch. it is not special branch. now default branch in GITHUB is not master but it is main branch. in git still master branch is default branch.

$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean


head is current location where we are working.
head is refered to last commit in master branch.
head is referd to last commit in current branch.
head is like pointer.

git branch command 

<<<<<<< HEAD
we can not delete currenr branch. first we have to switch to onother branch and then delete that branch.

git branch -d command for deleting branch. we can not delete current branch. but if we use git branch -D command then we can delete current branch also its force delete branch command.

git branch -m command for renaming branch. m stand for move.

we can only rename current branch. 
=======
will list all branch in current git repository. * this symbol  will be with current branch.

$ git branch
* master --> like this.

create branch..

git branch                command will list all branch in current git repository
git branch <branch name>  will create branch in current git repository. it make branch not switch to that branch we  will be on current branch.

we can use git switch < branch name> toi switch to the branch. head will point this branch.

we can not use space in branch naming.

git branch --> list all branch in current git repository.
git branch <branch name> will create branch in current git repository. it make branch not switch to that.
git switch <branch name> will switch to that branch name.

git commit -a -m message command will add all and commit with message.

git checkout <branch name> will also change the branch. same as git switch <branch name>

we create branch and switch to that branch. git branch <branch name> git switch <branch name>.

but we can also use git switch -c <branch name> to create branch and switch to that branch.

git checkout -b <branch name> will also create and switch to that branch.

git switch -c <branch name>.
git chechout -b <branch name>.

before switching branch we have to commit our work in current branch.
